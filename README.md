# TLS-PSK-required-libs
A TLS-PSK implementation for ESP8266. Includes two external libraries written by Spaniakos and Kokke. 
These libraries were modified to run on the ESP8266.

Kokke's original AES128 library: https://github.com/kokke/tiny-AES128-C

Spaniakos' original SHA1/SHA256 library: http://spaniakos.github.io/Cryptosuite/

Just move all the files into your arduino/libraries folder (usually found in your Documents folder)

After this,  install STL for avr: http://andybrown.me.uk/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/
